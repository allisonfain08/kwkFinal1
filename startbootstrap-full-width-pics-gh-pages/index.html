      <h1>Allison Fain</h1>
      <p class="lead">Rising senior at Johns Creek High School, expected to graduate spring 2020. 97 GPA</p>
      <p>Hello! I am a rising senior at Johns Creek High School and hope to be a computer science major with a minor in international affairs. I have light experience with Java, Javafx, C, and Python. My favorite book is "A Tale of Two Cities" by Charles Dickens, and I am fascinated by historical movements and believe us to be in the midst of a social revolution.</p>

      <p>As a leader in this camp, I facilitate elementary and middle school female campers as they move from different modules that each pertain to a field of engineering, as well as computer science. I worked with the campers in order to further their interest in the STEM related fields as well as narrow down their interests within the realm of engineering and computer science. On the matter of computing, the girls were able to use Scratch coding as well as sensors to create a functional robot that performed a basic action such as flapping construction paper wings based on the amount of light detected. </p>
